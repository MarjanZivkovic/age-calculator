# Frontend Mentor - Age calculator app solution

This is a solution to the [Age calculator app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/age-calculator-app-dF9DFFpj-Q). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS 
- JavaScript 

### Notes

The calculated age is approximate and it can vary by a day or two. I'm sure there's a way to convert milliseconds into the correct number of years, months, and days but that was enough math for one project for me.

### What I learned

I learned that there are lots of possible outcomes when validating a form that has multiple fields, and I must be very thorough. Also, learned a lot about the Date() object. 

I'm really proud of finally starting to use some helper functions that helped reduce lines of my code.
